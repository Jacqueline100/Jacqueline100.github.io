My name is Danyi Huang. I am a graduate student studying computational linguistics in the MDS program. I am gonna introduce a lab I found particularly interesting in hte MDS program so far. I feel the lab in DSCI521 is really interesting. We explore the GitHub and we can contribute to someone else's blog. It seems like we can communicate with each other in git language.
