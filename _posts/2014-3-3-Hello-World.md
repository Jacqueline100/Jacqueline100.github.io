title: My First Blog Post
---

I discussed with David in 542 to create a personal blog using GitHub pages. This is an easy (and free) way to take control of my online presence. It provides an avenue to share my thoughts online and David helped me to debug for some problems according to the style of the page. I am pretty enthusiastic to construct my own personal blog!

Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
